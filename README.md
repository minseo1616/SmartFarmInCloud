Smart Farm in Cloud by 2014041023 권민서

Build my smart farm system in cloud! My system should satisfy following requirements.

- Monitor temperature and lightness on every 1ms
- Use an analogous data for a ligthness sensor. 
- Build a server in cloud and install MySQL and Apache into it. 
- Send sensor data from Raspberry Pi to the server every 10s. 
- Turn on FAN when the temperature goes beyond 27 degrees (C) for 5 second. 
- Turn on LED when the lightness goes below 900 and turn off it otherwise. 
- Each functionality should be performed by an independant thread (use multi-threaded programming, 4 threads) 
- Use a signal mechanism when threads need to communicate each other. 
- Collect data for more than 1 minute.
